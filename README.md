C Projects

This repository contains a collection of programs and small projects written in C, created to practice and strengthen core programming and computer science fundamentals.
The repository focuses on logical correctness, clarity of implementation, and understanding how C works at a low level.


Contents
Basic and intermediate C programs
Algorithm and problem-solving implementations
Arrays, pointers, and functions
Data structure experiments
Mathematical and logical programs



How to Compile and Run
Use a standard C compiler such as GCC:
gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c11 filename.c -o program
./program


Notes
Written in standard C (C11)
Some programs represent learning experiments
Code may be updated or improved over time
Focus is on understanding fundamentals rather than using libraries
